Automatic elementary code style guidelines
··········································
Build and install uncrustify, then go to src/ and run uncrustify like this:
$ uncrustify -c ../etc/uncrustify-elementary-vala.cfg */*.vala *.vala --replace

There are one or two little quirks with the program though, one of them is it
adds a space to the underscore before translatable strings, as in _("string")
to _ ("string"). I expect that's because it regards the underscore as the name
of a function. The code still works with the space though, and if you don't
mind it looking like that then we can just let it do that. I included
LanguageText.vala once and then replaced _ ( with _(.

This is what you'd run to not include LanguageText.vala:
$ uncrustify -c ../etc/uncrustify-elementary-vala.cfg */*.vala Application.vala Resources.vala --replace
