## How to Install
If you use elementary OS, you can get it directly from the AppCenter.

The main target is Elementary, but this should work also on GNOME 3. The bad news is that we have experienced problems with Wayland (i.e. used in the last Ubuntu). We are working hard to fix those issues regarding Wayland. Anyway, if you want to check you should use the latest [.deb release](https://github.com/spheras/desktopfolder/releases). To install the .deb with apt:

`sudo apt install ./com.github.spheras.desktopfolder_[version]_amd64.deb`

Open it like any other app after installing. Desktop Folder will launch automatically when you next log in.
